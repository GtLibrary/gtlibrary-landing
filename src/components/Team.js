                As civilizations across the globe hang in the balance, the Library seeks to pump wonder
          into the hearts and minds of all who breathe free air.  
          At the Library you will see the dead are not gone; they are not forgotten.`,

        content: `There are only a set number of Culture Coins ever minted. 
          The administrators will hold some in reserve, but most are brought into circulation by the community using the ICO and dexes. 
          The token's internal dex has the unique property that any CC returned will automatically be burned. This means the token is strictly deflationary. 
          The primary function of Culture Coin is as a gas token--its primary role is to be burned for products and services, like for casting spells in the games--leaving those left in circulation worth more.`,

        title: "Why Stake Your Culture Coin?",
        content: `Staking is the process of burning Culture Coin in exchange for a principal plus interest payment at a later date. 
          Staking is a mechanism built directly into the Culture Coin tokenï¿½s underlying smart contract.`,

                            <p className="member-description">Born Rayun Rayaun, John R Raymond is the author of the Scarab Cycle. His background in Byzantine Agreement and cryptography lead him to create The Great Library when it became clear to him that the publishing industry was ripe for a shake up. He is currently the Head Librarian with The Great Library and, when not busy with his own books, he works with others editing theirs. He likes both cats and dogs and supports the arts in whatever form they take.</p>

                            <p className="member-description">Lawrence Stanley works as a scientist and engineer and has struggled all his life to reconcile his knowledge of geology, astronomy, biology and genetics with his religious heritage and personal experience.  He undertook a quest to find the answer, even if it meant losing his faith, or turning his back on science, depending on what he found.  He has studied many scientific and sacred texts.  His startling conclusion is both are correct ways of looking at the world. They are in agreement and complementary.  He undertook writing a series of novels, designed to entertain, and perhaps to heal the wounds resulting from centuries of condemnation on both sides. The world has too much hate and suspicion. That changes today.</p>
