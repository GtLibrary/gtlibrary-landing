                            <p className="featurehead-description">The Great Library is a community of readers, authors, and artists.

The Great Library is a free-access platform that allows authors to share their works with readers. Unlike Patreon, The Great Library does not have a subscription or traditional payment system, but uses WEB3 tokens to mediate access to the art, books, games, illustrations, etc. It also curates works to ensure quality and relevancy, which is something that Patreon does not do. Additionally, The Great Library offers tools for authors to interact with their readers, such as chat and voting, as well as providing analytics to help authors better understand their readers. In addtion to art and illustrations, The Great Library includes games and other digital products.</p>

Where other ebook formats cannot be resold, all NFTs sold through the site can be resold at any time, and are the only way to achieve true ownership of an ebook.</p>

                            <p>Bookmark Tokens are Image-NFTs and so much more. Like the Book Tokens, Bookmark Tokens can be bought, sold, and transfered using WEB3 technologies. But beyond pointing to illustrations and images from the books they are associated with, Bookmark Tokens act like properties and can be improved using the site's cryptocurrency. These improvements impact the games as well as the AI capabilities tied to the tokens.</p>
